<p><img src="../../images/2024-earphone/amazon.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>In this bustling world, whether you&rsquo;re a commuter, a student, a working professional, or a busy homemaker, everyone deserves their own quiet time. Headphones are not just a tool for playing music; they are also a window that allows us to escape from the noisy outside world and immerse ourselves in the sounds we love.</p>
<p>On the subway during your commute, a pair of headphones can immerse you in music or podcasts, allowing you to forget about the noise in the carriage. In the library or a café, headphones help you focus on studying or working, creating your own exclusive space. At home, a comfortable pair of headphones allows you to enjoy private music moments without disturbing your family. Whether it&rsquo;s studying, working, or leisure, a good pair of headphones can bring you a wonderful music experience.</p>
<p>Therefore, when choosing headphones, it&rsquo;s not just about pursuing perfect sound quality, but also about finding a product that can be closely connected to our lives and meet diverse listening needs. Whether you&rsquo;re a novice looking for headphones or a seasoned user, I hope this article can help you better understand the world of headphones and find the sound that suits you best.</p>
<p>Below, I&rsquo;ll briefly share some common technical terms for headphones and provide purchasing recommendations to help you better understand your needs when choosing headphones.</p>
<p>Because headphones can be quite professional tools, Bluetooth headphones priced below 90 USD are considered budget products. These headphones typically have basic Bluetooth functions such as music playback and calls but may lack some high-end features. Nevertheless, within this price range, you can still find some cost-effective products, especially entry-level models from well-known brands.</p>
<p>This article will focus on recommending budget Bluetooth headphones while carefully selecting a few sellers with relatively low prices and decent sales volume. If you&rsquo;re interested in a particular product, you can click the link to purchase it.</p>
<h3 id="common-technical-terms">Common Technical Terms</h3>
<p>These technical terms may affect the selection and user experience of headphones. Understanding these terms can help better understand the performance and functionality of the products.</p>
<h5 id="patented-technologies">Patented Technologies</h5>
<ul>
<li>ACAA™ 3.0 Coaxial Dynamic Driver: ACAA™ is a patented audio technology from a certain brand, and 3.0 Coaxial Dynamic Driver may be a version of this technology or a specific upgrade for it. Coaxial dynamic driver typically refers to the headphone&rsquo;s driver unit, and ACAA™ may refer to a special driver unit design or technology developed by the brand.</li>
<li>Hybrid Noise Cancelling Technology: Hybrid noise cancelling technology refers to headphones that combine multiple noise cancelling technologies, such as active noise cancelling and passive noise cancelling. Active noise cancelling cancels out external noise by emitting anti-noise, while passive noise cancelling isolates noise through the headphone&rsquo;s structure and materials. Hybrid noise cancelling technology combines these two methods to achieve better noise cancelling effects.</li>
<li>ANC: Active Noise Cancellation, a technology that cancels or reduces external noise interference by emitting sound waves opposite to environmental noise, providing a better listening experience.</li>
<li>DSEE Extreme: A sound processing technology used to enhance music quality by improving the clarity and dynamic range of low-quality audio.</li>
<li>LDAC High-Resolution Audio: LDAC is a Bluetooth audio coding technology developed by Sony, capable of high-resolution audio transmission for a higher quality music experience. LDAC can provide higher bitrates in Bluetooth transmission, resulting in better audio quality.</li>
<li>aptX: A Bluetooth audio coding technology developed by Qualcomm aimed at providing higher quality audio transmission and improving sound quality.</li>
<li>AAC: Advanced Audio Coding, an audio encoding format commonly used for iOS devices. Bluetooth headphones that support AAC encoding can provide better sound quality.</li>
<li>Bluetooth Versions: Bluetooth versions are typically represented by numbers such as Bluetooth 4.0, Bluetooth 5.0, etc. Different Bluetooth versions indicate different supported features and performance. Generally, newer versions support higher data transfer rates, more stable connections, lower power consumption, etc. You can find Bluetooth version information in the product specifications or descriptions.</li>
<li>LE Audio Technology: A new Bluetooth audio technology, where LE stands for Low Energy, designed to provide higher quality, more stable audio transmission while reducing energy consumption, thus extending device battery life.</li>
<li>QuietSmart 2.0: A hybrid active noise cancelling technology that combines multiple noise cancelling technologies to provide superior noise cancelling effects, which may include features like intelligent environmental perception, multi-channel noise cancelling, and adaptive noise cancelling.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="special-features">Special Features</h5>
<ul>
<li>Transparent Mode: A feature found in some active noise cancelling headphones that allows external sounds to pass through the headphones, enabling users to hear ambient sounds when needed.</li>
<li>IPX Rating: Used to describe the waterproof rating of headphones, such as IPX4, IPX5, etc., representing the headphones&rsquo; resistance to water, ranging from waterproof to sweat-resistant levels.</li>
<li>Hi-Res Audio: High-Resolution Audio, an audio standard defined by the Japan Audio Association, requiring audio sampling rates of at least 96 kHz/24-bit or higher to achieve higher quality music experience.</li>
<li>Closed-Back Headphones: Headphones that seal around the ears, providing better sound isolation.</li>
<li>Dynamic Headphones: Headphones that use dynamic drivers (transducers), which are a common type of headphone driver. The driver is the component responsible for producing sound, usually a small speaker. Here, the diameter of the driver is referred to as 5 millimeters.</li>
<li>Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): A technology built into headphones or earbuds that can collect environmental noise and generate sound waves opposite to it to eliminate or reduce the impact of external noise on hearing. Passive noise cancellation refers to the ability of headphones or earbuds themselves to block out external noise to some extent without the need for electronic devices or processors to generate opposing sound waves. Passive noise cancellation is usually achieved through well-sealed ear cups or ear tips.</li>
<li>Balanced Armature: Balanced armature drivers use one or more balanced arms with small magnets and coils attached to them. When current flows through the coil, it generates force in the magnetic field, causing the balanced arm to vibrate and produce sound. Balanced armature drivers are typically smaller than dynamic drivers and can provide higher frequency detail and accuracy. Balanced armature drivers are generally more suitable for high-frequency detail and mid-high frequency performance.</li>
<li>Dynamic Driver: Dynamic drivers are one of the most common driver technologies, consisting of a magnet and a diaphragm (also known as a coil) connected to it. When current flows through the coil, it generates a magnetic field that causes the diaphragm to vibrate, producing sound. Dynamic drivers typically have better low-frequency response and dynamic range. Dynamic drivers are more suitable for bass performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="buying-guide">Buying Guide</h3>
